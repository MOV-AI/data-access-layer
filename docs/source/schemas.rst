Schemas and validation
======================

Written after an incomplete review.

Available schemas
-----------------

- `1.0` - used to determine how scope fields are written into redis
- `2.0` - seems not to be used
- `2.4` - used to validate scope fields before writing into redis (only used for `Translation` scope)
